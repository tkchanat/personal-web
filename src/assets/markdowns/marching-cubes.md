## Description
A course project for Spring 2019 [Computer Graphics and Interaction (DH2323)](https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/DH2323?l=en) in Royal Institute of Technology. This work presents a real-time smoothed particle hydrodynamics visualization with metaball.
This is a two-person group work to show our knowledge over OpenGL rendering technique, as well as real-time physics simulation and optimization. We used smoothed particle hydrodynamics for the particle physics evaluated on the CPU. While the rendering is done mainly on geometry shader. Marching cube algorithm is implemented for visualizing the isosurface of metaballs. The surface is then shaded using phong light model. You can find more about our process in our [development blog](https://alexander-hjelm.github.io/metaballs-glfw/making-voxel-cubes/).
