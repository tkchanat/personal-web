## Motivation
This is a solo project which I made in my spare time. This is the first time I get into real computer graphics programming with OpenGL and no external library except GLFW for window creation. The application is basically a playground where you can explore the behaviour of Bezier and B-spline curves.

## Description
User can add control points by right clicking any empty space, and able to drag those control points freely within the window. Pressing 1 can show/hide the lines defining the convex hull, 2 for toggling between Bezier and B-spline curves, 3 to form a loop with all control points. The resolution (step size) can be increased or decreased with +/- button.
