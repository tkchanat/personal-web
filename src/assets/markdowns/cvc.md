## Description
This is a two-player VR simulation serious game developed during my summer internship at Queen Elizabeth Hospital. The purpose is to aid medical trainees to familiarize with Central Venous Catheters(CVC) procedures as to avoid incidents. In the simulation, one player takes the nurse role while another acts as a doctor. The nurse is responsible to prepare equipment required for performing the CVC and run through the checklist items. The actual procedures are then performed by the doctor. Task boards are placed on each side of the room so that players can learn while enjoying the experience.
